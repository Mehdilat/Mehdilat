## My Work

This space is dedicated to sharing some of the projects I have been involved in. Each repository represents a unique blend of creativity and technical skill, showcasing the application of machine learning and computer vision to solve real-world problems.

Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute to the repositories. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on future projects, don't hesitate to reach out.

### [Body Mass Index (BMI) Machine Learning Classification Pipeline](https://github.com/Mehdilat/Project-BodyMassIndex-ClassificationPipeline)

This project involves developing, training, and evaluating machine learning models (SVM, KNN, Random Forests, XGBoost) to predict BMI categories based on individual data, integrating the best model into a Flask API, and deploying it using Docker on AWS EC2, with the application accessible for interaction and predictions at a specified URL.

### [Face Classification using a Pre-trained VGGFace Model](https://github.com/Mehdilat/Project-ClearFace-Classification)

This project leverages a pre-trained VGGFace CNN model with transfer learning for binary facial classification, utilizing image augmentation and a weighted sampling strategy to handle class imbalance, and fine-tunes the model with specific training parameters for the detection of facial accessories and hair.

### [Automatic Face Detection, Cropping and Resizing for Profile Picture Production](https://github.com/Mehdilat/Project-ProfilePicture-AutomaticFaceDetection)

This project develops an automated pipeline using PyTorch and a pre-trained YOLOv7 model for detecting, cropping, and resizing faces in images to create standardized profile pictures, with a recommendation to download and view the potentially large files locally for optimal performance.

### [Semantic Segmentation of Aerial Satellite Images](https://github.com/Mehdilat/Project-SatelliteImages-SemanticSegmentation)

This project implements a UNet Convolutional Neural Network for the semantic segmentation of aerial satellite imagery, specifically targeting the ISPRS Potsdam dataset, to differentiate and classify distinct land cover types in urban landscapes.
