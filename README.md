# Welcome to Mahdi's GitHub

Hello, I'm Mahdi! I'm a Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Cloud Computing enthusiast, currently working at CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) in France.

## About Me

With a solid foundation acquired from CentraleSup√©lec (France), holding a Master's degree in Control, Signal, and Image Processing, complemented by an Engineering Degree from Ecole Nationale Polytechnique (Algeria) in Control and Signal Processing, I've developed a profound understanding of the multifaceted aspects of machine learning and computer vision.

## Interests

- **Machine Learning**
- **Deep Learning**
- **Computer Vision**
- **Generative AI**
- **Natural Language Processing**
- **Cloud Computing**

## My Work

This repository is to act like a high level overview of the data science projects I've worked on. Each project's `README.md` should act as a full description of the project, but I'll provide a short description here for convenience. All of these projects are in Python. Links are provided to projects whose code can be made public.

### [Body Mass Index (BMI) Machine Learning Classification Pipeline](https://github.com/Mehdilat/Project-BodyMassIndex-ClassificationPipeline)

This project involves developing, training, and evaluating machine learning models (SVM, KNN, Random Forests, XGBoost) to predict BMI categories based on individual data, integrating the best model into a Flask API, and deploying it using Docker on AWS EC2, with the application accessible for interaction and predictions at a specified URL.

### [Face Cover Detection using a Pre-trained VGGFace Model](https://github.com/Mehdilat/Project-FaceCover-Detection)

This project leverages a pre-trained VGGFace CNN model with transfer learning for binary facial classification, utilizing image augmentation and a weighted sampling strategy to handle class imbalance, and fine-tunes the model with specific training parameters for the detection of facial accessories and hair.

### [Automatic Face Detection, Cropping and Resizing for Profile Picture Production](https://github.com/Mehdilat/Project-ProfilePicture-AutomaticFaceDetection)

This project develops an automated pipeline using PyTorch and a pre-trained YOLOv7 model for detecting, cropping, and resizing faces in images to create standardized profile pictures, with a recommendation to download and view the potentially large files locally for optimal performance.

### [Semantic Segmentation of Aerial Satellite Images](https://github.com/Mehdilat/Project-SatelliteImages-SemanticSegmentation)

This project implements a UNet Convolutional Neural Network for the semantic segmentation of aerial satellite imagery, specifically targeting the ISPRS Potsdam dataset, to differentiate and classify distinct land cover types in urban landscapes.
