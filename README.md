# Welcome to Mahdi's GitHub

Hello, I'm Mahdi! I'm a dedicated researcher and enthusiast in the fields of machine learning and computer vision, currently working at CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique).

## About Me

With a solid foundation acquired from CentraleSupélec, holding a Master's degree in Control, Signal, and Image Processing, complemented by an Engineering Degree from Ecole Nationale Polytechnique in Control and Signal Processing, I've developed a profound understanding of the multifaceted aspects of machine learning and computer vision.

Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute to the repositories. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on future projects, don't hesitate to reach out.

### [Face Classification using a Pre-trained VGGFace Model](https://github.com/Mehdilat/Project-ClearFace-Classification)

This project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using transfer learning, specifically a pre-trained VGGFace model, for binary facial classification to detect the presence of accessories and facial hair. The model is adapted for a two-class problem, and its preprocessing includes image resizing and normalization. To address class imbalance, a random weighted sampler and image augmentation techniques (like horizontal flips, rotations, jitter, and gaussian blur) are used during training. The CNN model is initialized with frozen backbone layers, and various training parameters are set, such as epochs, batch size, and learning rate.

### [Automatic Face Detection, Cropping and Resizing for Profile Picture Production](https://github.com/Mehdilat/Project-ProfilePicture-AutomaticFaceDetection)

This project consists in implementing a pipeline for automatic face detection, cropping and resizing into the given shapes for profile pictures, using Pytorch and a pre-trained Yolov7 detection model.

### [Semantic Segmentation of Aerial Satellite Images](https://github.com/Mehdilat/Project-SatelliteImages-SemanticSegmentation)

This project consists in implementing a UNet CNN architecture for semantic segmentation of satellite ISPRS Potsdam data.
